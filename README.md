📋 Overview

The NCDMB Equipment Monitoring System provides a centralized dashboard for tracking the operational status of critical oil & gas equipment. It surfaces real-time status (active, warning, inactive) alongside maintenance recommendations for each asset — helping operations teams prioritize inspections and preventive maintenance across multiple site types.

Equipment Tracked


🛢️ Storage Tanks — liquid level monitoring & corrosion inspection
🌲 Christmas Trees — valve inspection & emergency shutdown testing
🔧 Wellheads — pressure monitoring & routine inspection
🏗️ Drilling Rigs — preventive maintenance scheduling
⚙️ Mud Pumps — pressure monitoring & seal replacement tracking
🛤️ Pipelines — leak detection & integrity testing



✨ Features


📊 Real-time equipment status dashboard (active / warning / inactive)
🔍 Maintenance recommendations per asset
🌍 Multi-site tracking (onshore, offshore, tank farms, pipeline corridors)
🔄 RESTful API for equipment data
🛡️ Production-grade deployment with auto-restart on failure

Equipment Data

The application is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu. Nginx handles incoming HTTP traffic and proxies requests to a Gunicorn-managed Flask backend. Systemd supervises the Gunicorn process, automatically restarting it on failure and on server reboot — ensuring high availability without manual intervention.

⚙️ Local Setup

Prerequisites


Python 3.12+
pip


Installation

bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fortuneeffiong123/ncdmb-system-repo.git
cd ncdmb-system-repo/backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the development server
python app.py

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Production Run (Gunicorn)

bashgunicorn -w 3 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 app:app


📦 Deployment

This project is deployed on AWS EC2 with the following production setup:


Gunicorn runs the Flask app with multiple worker processes for concurrency and resilience.
systemd manages the Gunicorn process — automatically restarting it on crash and on server reboot.
Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding public traffic to the Gunicorn server running on 127.0.0.1:5000.
